# 🚗 Parking Space Counter (OpenCV)

This project uses **OpenCV** to detect free and occupied parking spaces from a video or webcam feed.  
It works in two main steps:  
1. **Mark Parking Spots** – select the exact parking space positions using a simple mouse picker tool.  
2. **Count Occupancy** – process each frame to detect whether each spot is free or occupied in real-time.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time parking space counting
- Green/Red overlay for free/occupied spots
- Mouse tool for marking parking spaces
- Works with both video files and live webcam
- Adjustable detection threshold for better accuracy

## 📦 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AjaoFaisal/parking-space-counter-opencv.git
cd parking-space-counter-opencv
```

```bash
# (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
# macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate
# Windows:
.venv\\Scripts\\activate
```

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ▶️ Usage

### **1. Mark Parking Spaces**
```bash
python parking_space_picker.py
```
- **Left Click** – Add a parking spot (top-left corner of the rectangle)  
- **Right Click** – Remove a parking spot  
- Spots are saved in `car_park_pos` for later use.  

> **Note:** Use `image.png` (a still frame of your parking lot) when picking spots.

---

### **2. Run the Parking Counter**
```bash
python main.py
```
- **ESC** – Quit program  
- **S** – Save snapshot to `output.png`  

---

### **Webcam vs Video**
By default, `main.py` uses `video.mp4`.  
To use your webcam, change:
```python
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)  # Change 0 or 1 depending on your camera index
```
